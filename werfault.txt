Entry to registry, gpedit.msc (gui of registry).  Crashing application spawn Werfault.exe on new Windows.  Application
always make outbound TCP connection to IP block with MSFT owner.

This is norm; OS reporting many detail to maker.

What of old application crash, OK = terminate, cancel = debug.  I like this.

We may restore it, very simple:

secpol.msc -> Software Restriction Policies -> Additional Rules
insert of Path rule: disable werfault.exe


What of old application crash, OK = terminate, cancel = debug?  Again he return ))
